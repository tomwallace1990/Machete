157,"“I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders"
105,"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it."
103,"“You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”"
93,"“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered."
92,"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands"
91,"We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell.” It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend."
90,"I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret."
87,"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies"
87,"Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments."
86,"I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted."
85,"The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours"
83,"A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services"
82,"Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair"
82,"It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous"
79,"With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus."
79,"He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts."
78,"Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys."
75,"I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds."
74,"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer."
72,"I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race."
70,"I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever"
69,"I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure"
69,"Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”"
69,"With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me."
69,"A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university"
69,"“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations"
69,"I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict"
68,"But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine."
67,"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection"
67,"For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright."
67,"The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation"
66,"I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply."
66,"The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality."
65,"I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me"
65,"The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed."
65,"My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible."
65,"But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance"
64,"We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
     The path of its departure still is free.
Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
     Nought may endure but mutability."
64,"He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding."
64,"Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers."
63,"It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard"
63,"His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips."
63,"Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance."
63,"The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings."
63,"I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot."
63,"My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence"
62,"I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage"
62,"When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay."
62,"The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise"
62,"“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow"
62,"A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found."
62,"Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent."
61,"I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled"
61,"On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish"
61,"Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel"
61,"“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours"
61,"“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation"
61,"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror"
61,"It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly."
60,"There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her"
60,"By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge"
60,"“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French"
60,"Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world"
59,"Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood"
59,"When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees"
59,"This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue"
59,"“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection"
59,"The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle."
59,"I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach"
58,"The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life"
58,"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected"
58,"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been"
57,"She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight"
57,"I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life."
57,"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me."
57,"One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me."
57,"I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it"
57,"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin."
57,"But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “I shall be with you on your wedding-night,” I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable"
57,"And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides"
56,"It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world."
56,"Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe."
56,"“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village"
56,"So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters."
56,"By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, fire, milk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves"
56,"“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger"
56,"I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows"
56,"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself."
56,"——The sounding cataract
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to him
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, or any interest
Unborrow’d from the eye.

[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]"
55,"He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover"
55,"I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret"
55,"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise"
55,"During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame."
55,"She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family"
55,"“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”"
55,"The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him"
55,"Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me"
55,"This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend—“I will be with you on your wedding-night.” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings"

41,"Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children"

38,I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure
38,"every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept."

38,"What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me"
38,"I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish."
38,"In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July"

38,"He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise"

38,She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.
38,I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.

38,"But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear"
38,"We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed"

37,"Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption."

37,"Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world."

37,"For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own"
37,"Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations"
37,"The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion."
37,"If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”"
37,"A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses"
37,"“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd"

37,"I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand"
37,"I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone"
37,"Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances."
37,"As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations."
37,"She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled"
37,"I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow."
37,I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him
37,"But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart."
37,"You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed"
37,"Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.”"
37,"I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection"
37,"The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited"
37,"She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species."
37,"The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it"
37,"But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat"
37,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes."

37,"Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest"
37,"As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them"
37,"Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself"
37,"My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness."
37,"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor"

37,"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance."
37,"“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey"
37,"Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me"
37,"This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures"
37,"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion"

36,"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour"
36,"My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit"
36,"And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time"
36,"As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out"
36,"I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval."

36,"I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings."
36,"We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish"

35,"Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world"
35,"Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick"
35,"Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter"
35,"“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty"

35,"He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved"
35,"He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end"

34,"They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light"

34,"For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath"
34,"They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace."

34,"Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard."
34,"Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference"
34,"My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”"
34,"It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was."
34,"“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha"

34,"I learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages"
34,"But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party."
34,"A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health"
34,"The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality."
34,"The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever."
34,But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream
34,"But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.”"
34,"But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death"
33,"In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea"
33,"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence."
33,"They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures."

33,"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet"
33,"I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion."
33,"“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.”"
33,"One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive"
33,"She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage"
33,"Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness"
33,The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me

33,"“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad"
33,"Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately."
33,"Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors."
33,"“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions."
33,"He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed"
33,"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch’s Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter"
33,"I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon"

33,"I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach"

33,"I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family"
33,"The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare"
33,"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon"
33,"This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it."
33,"They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm"
33,"It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below"
33,"Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.”"
33,"My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country"
33,"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.”"
33,"I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour."
33,"“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented"
33,"In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost."
33,"He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance"
33,"The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me"
33,"The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey"
33,"When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors"
33,"They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives"
33,"He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse"
33,"I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, “Alas"

32,"I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans"
32,"So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession."
32,"Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation"
32,"Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”"
32,"You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been"
32,"Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge"
32,"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self"
32,"But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity."
32,"In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration."
32,"My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery."
32,"The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished"
32,"He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers"
32,"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep"
32,"At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress"
32,"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt"
32,"The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe"
32,"I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley"
32,"My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale"
32,"“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it"
32,"They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves."
32,"I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends"

32,"Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me."
32,"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity."
32,"I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade."
32,"I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched"
32,"“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet."
32,"And then I bent over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake.’"
32,"A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably"
32,"For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it"
32,"Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”"
32,"My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief"
32,"I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger"

32,"He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided"
32,"Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places."
32,For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers
32,"The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me"
32,"As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men."

32,Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears
32,He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.

15,From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion
15,"‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my annihilation"
15,"Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship"
15,Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was
15,I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror
15,"Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage"
15,"I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me"
15,"I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood."
15,"“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast"
15,"I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection"
15,My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”
15,"Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”"
15,It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country
15,"I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment."
15,"The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—"
15,"We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February"
15,Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves
15,"Andrew’s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us"
15,"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate"
15,"Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains"
15,"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery"
15,"I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes.”"
15,"“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension"
15,"“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived"
15,"You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food"
15,"I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation"
15,I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge
15,"The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff"
15,"It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age"
15,I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin
15,"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame."
15,Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects
15,"“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make"
15,My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost
15,But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.
15,"I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how."
15,Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows
15,Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed
15,At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak
15,"The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms"
15,What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow
15,"Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely"
14,You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment
14,"How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow"
14,I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking
14,No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter
14,"On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent"
14,"His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering"
14,"By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully."
14,"You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair"
14,Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest
14,"They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born"
14,The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home
14,"My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, “Ah"
14,"My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”"
14,"I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple"
14,"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual"
14,"And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel"
14,She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all
14,"He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science"
14,"Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted."
14,I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
14,"Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town."
14,None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science
14,It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being
14,A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch
14,How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting.”
14,"By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself"
14,My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself
14,This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months
14,I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
14,"Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household"
14,"Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words"
14,Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly
14,"The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual"
14,"I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands."
14,"“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable"
14,"“Poor William.” said he, “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother"
14,Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. He was the murderer
14,But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell
14,Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve
14,"But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest.”"
14,In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched
14,"“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel, if you are innocent"
14,He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate
14,I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers
14,"Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven.”"
14,How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am
14,"Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears"
14,There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind
14,"Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character"
14,Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats
14,For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice
14,Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable
14,I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire
14,I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country
14,"I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it"
14,“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours
14,"He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage"
14,"“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them"
14,"“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition"
14,This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter
14,"I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own"
14,"He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him."
14,“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only
14,"“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them.’"
14,"“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered"
14,"I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope"
14,"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being"
14,"But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted."
14,"Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer"
14,Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me
14,"My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit"
14,"Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments"
14,"I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone"
14,"Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness"
14,I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape
14,"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced"
14,"Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations"
14,“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend
14,Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness
14,In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice
14,"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn"
14,This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me
14,Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr
14,I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created
14,I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations
14,I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva
14,"If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied"
14,In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned to Geneva
14,For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
14,"However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night"
14,Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change
14,But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event
14,"Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate"
14,“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail
14,I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh
14,"Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly"
14,"His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice"
14,Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete
14,"Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth"
14,"You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return"
14,The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed
14,I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend
14,The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed
14,"Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit"
14,"It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir"
14,I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend
14,"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment"
14,"No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine"
14,"Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me"
14,"You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself"
14,He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.
13,"Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid"
13,"And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose"
13,I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St
13,There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand
13,He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree
13,"I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace"
13,"Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things"
13,"I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight"
13,Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity
13,It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known
13,Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection
13,"I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me"
13,She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal
13,She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
13,"But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M"
13,"“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing"
13,"To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death"
13,"These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour"
13,"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful"
13,"I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college"
13,"A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness"
13,"It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence"
13,"“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me"
13,Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think.
13,Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better
13,"You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly"
13,"I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt"
13,"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours"
13,"But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it"
13,"“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”"
13,I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind
13,Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother
13,The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact
13,It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house
13,"I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece"
13,I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own
13,During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture
13,"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned."
13,My father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events
13,A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey
13,It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent
13,But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee
13,As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed
13,I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees
13,"How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects"
13,"I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn"
13,"I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame"
13,"Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep."
13,"The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns"
13,“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it
13,The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep
13,I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
13,"“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide"
13,"Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself"
13,The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder
13,"I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species"
13,"‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French.’"
13,"But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained"
13,"“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage"
13,"“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps"
13,"“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’"
13,We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition
13,My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects
13,"Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world"
13,"I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”"
13,But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union
13,"This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”"
13,"Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family"
13,"Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage"
13,One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion
13,"“This is what it is to live,” he cried; “now I enjoy existence"
13,During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns
13,"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland"
13,"I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn"
13,"“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice"
13,Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife
13,"“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice"
13,“Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”
13,Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence
13,"Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me"
13,"My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.”"
13,On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death
13,"But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it"
13,"When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation"
13,Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth
13,"The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation."
13,I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
13,This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor
13,But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
13,He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
13,I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny
13,"For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking"
13,It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.
13,"Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die"
13,"A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse"
13,"For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires"
12,How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother
12,Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board
12,“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion.”
12,"The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection"
12,Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer
12,Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor
12,"She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman"
12,Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth
12,His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar
12,The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine
12,My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence
12,"Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children"
12,Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education
12,At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes
12,"“Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense.”"
12,"Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy"
12,Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
12,"“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you"
12,"“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter"
12,How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest
12,Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.
12,"Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view"
12,"I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak"
12,How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome.
12,"The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever"
12,"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind"
12,Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid
12,"Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me"
12,"The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom"
12,"But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.”"
12,Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”
12,You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine
12,"“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked"
12,"“I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang is past"
12,God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst
12,"“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer also"
12,"Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you"
12,I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate
12,"All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought"
12,"Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier"
12,Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds
12,The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes
12,"Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery"
12,There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies
12,"Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light"
12,"By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you"
12,Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures
12,But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose
12,Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends
12,Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian
12,“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s Ruins of Empires
12,When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me
12,The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure
12,The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
12,I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel
12,But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men
12,It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation
12,Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.’
12,How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being
12,"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind"
12,I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman
12,But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised
12,"My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy"
12,"I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh"
12,"Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe"
12,"And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry"
12,But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind
12,He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view
12,He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives
12,But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
12,"“Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous"
12,"Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,"
12,"I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”"
12,"Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”"
12,"Kirwin with gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”"
12,"I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,"
12,"I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter.”"
12,"“You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you"
12,"The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered"
12,But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse
12,Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind
12,"As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated"
12,"“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom"
12,And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life
12,"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task"
12,The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours
12,I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information
12,"I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration"
12,Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy
12,Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes
12,"“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for some great enterprise"
12,But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy
12,"Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand"
12,"Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult"
12,"His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient"
12,"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that"
12,"I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”"
12,My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment
12,What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me
12,"I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips"
12,“Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse
12,Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears
12,"“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome"
12,But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil
12,Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice
11,What may not be expected in a country of eternal light
11,This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years
11,"My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading"
11,Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking
11,"If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never."
11,I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties
11,"Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again."
11,What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man.
11,I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
11,"As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance"
11,"I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man"
11,"If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes"
11,Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience
11,"He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake"
11,No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself
11,And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval
11,All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable
11,"She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death"
11,You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names
11,I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
11,"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed"
11,Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family
11,"Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a blessing to us"
11,"my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write."
11,"On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—"
11,"When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh"
11,"A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain"
11,"Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness.”"
11,"The gates were open, and I hastened to my father’s house"
11,"“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty"
11,"“Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope"
11,"She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer"
11,My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial
11,"I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result."
11,"You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold"
11,"Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears"
11,Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue
11,"I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer"
11,"Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded"
11,Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you
11,Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion
11,"I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution"
11,“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story
11,“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless
11,“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me
11,“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends
11,“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin
11,His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
11,"She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination"
11,“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books
11,"These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them."
11,The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away
11,At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors
11,My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror
11,I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
11,"Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not"
11,"“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey"
11,The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment
11,"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer"
11,At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude
11,And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society
11,I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed
11,The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque
11,"This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape"
11,"Paul’s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history."
11,"But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart"
11,In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan
11,"It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged"
11,"I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.”"
11,"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears"
11,"Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind"
11,"While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase"
11,"I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied"
11,"These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr"
11,"I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr"
11,"But where is he, why does he not hasten to me.”"
11,My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection
11,"This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”"
11,I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight
11,A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her
11,Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated
11,The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
11,I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves
11,"Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships"
11,How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south
11,On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair
11,Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.”
11,"I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea."
11,"“They shout,” I said, “because they will soon return to England.”"
11,"I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”"
11,"The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed"
11,"But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation."
11,I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself
11,I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished
11,Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
11,“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief
10,"Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative"
10,This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia
10,Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element
10,I never saw a man in so wretched a condition
10,But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.”
10,But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.
10,Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous
10,"But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him"
10,We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin
10,Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva
10,He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance
10,This expectation will now be the consolation of your father
10,I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks
10,"My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”"
10,"I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream"
10,"Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman"
10,For this I had deprived myself of rest and health
10,"I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me"
10,He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit
10,In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
10,"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true"
10,Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man
10,"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M"
10,A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy
10,We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return
10,How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence
10,Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town
10,"These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent."
10,"If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more"
10,This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean
10,Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself
10,About this time we retired to our house at Belrive
10,I performed the first part of my journey on horseback
10,Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke
10,"Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust"
10,I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend
10,"Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me"
10,"We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock"
10,"“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep"
10,“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment
10,"“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early"
10,"The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans."
10,‘Hateful day when I received life.’ I exclaimed in agony
10,"“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage"
10,Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer
10,"“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor"
10,“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends.’
10,You and your family are the friends whom I seek
10,Do not you desert me in the hour of trial.’
10,Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me
10,I entreat you not to reason with me any more
10,“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense
10,I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’
10,You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces
10,"In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me"
10,“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage
10,“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me
10,Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery
10,"I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—"
10,"At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St"
10,I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains
10,"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St"
10,"You are my creator, but I am your master; obey.”"
10,I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber
10,I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror
10,Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life
10,"My father,” said I, “how little do you know me"
10,"You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain"
10,"If he were vanquished, I should be a free man"
10,It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired
10,"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror"
10,This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
10,What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know
10,One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare
10,With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart
10,"If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause."
10,"And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind"
10,Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock
10,They looked at one another and were unable to reply
10,All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble
10,"I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst"
10,The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion
10,And now it is ended; there is my last victim.”
10,Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery
10,I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion
10,But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal
9,"Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question"
9,Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise
9,He asked me the history of my earlier years
9,Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
9,For a long time I was their only care
9,He was a boy of singular talent and fancy
9,Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress
9,No mortal could support the horror of that countenance
9,During all that time Henry was my only nurse
9,Clerval then put the following letter into my hands
9,The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance
9,"Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all"
9,To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp
9,How altered every thing might be during that time
9,I saw him too; he was free last night.”
9,"“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”"
9,"who is safe, if she be convicted of crime"
9,"As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered"
9,"“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent"
9,I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt
9,“How shall I ever again believe in human goodness
9,“Why did you rob me of my last consolation
9,Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you
9,My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them
9,I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony
9,Have we lost the power of rendering you happy
9,My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix
9,At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix
9,I spent the following day roaming through the valley
9,A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains
9,"Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”"
9,The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge
9,Shall I not then hate them who abhor me
9,"I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness"
9,Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.”
9,These motives urged me to comply with his demand
9,[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder
9,No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused
9,“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun
9,“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform
9,"She did not appear to understand him, but smiled"
9,“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply
9,“The name of the old man was De Lacey
9,Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience
9,“But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions
9,At length the thought of you crossed my mind
9,"Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’"
9,Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind
9,"My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever"
9,My father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay
9,Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever
9,"Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.”"
9,“Why do you answer me so roughly.” I replied
9,Why am I to give an account of myself
9,"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself"
9,How can I describe my sensations on beholding it
9,"I stretched out my hand to him and cried,"
9,"William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”"
9,"My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered"
9,In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth
9,The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure
9,"I see him now, excellent and venerable old man"
9,The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness
9,Cease; you know not what it is you say.”
9,"You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”"
9,I will hover near and direct the steel aright.
9,My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion
9,"Are you, then, so easily turned from your design"
9,"“Do so, if you will; but I will not"
9,I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it
9,The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches
9,"“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being"
9,“But it is true that I am a wretch
8,I commenced by inuring my body to hardship
8,My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus
8,My affection for my guest increases every day
8,Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught
8,This promise drew from me the warmest thanks
8,I remained for several years their only child
8,She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself
8,The day of my departure at length arrived
8,"By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came"
8,"He meant to please, and he tormented me"
8,"And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune"
8,She was very earnest to see the corpse
8,"“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty"
8,"“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth"
8,And then of what use would be pursuit
8,"“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears"
8,Concerning the picture she could give no account.
8,I believed in her innocence; I knew it
8,"“I did confess, but I confessed a lie"
8,"I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence"
8,I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”
8,"Live, and be happy, and make others so.”"
8,She perished on the scaffold as a murderess.
8,"Justine died, she rested, and I was alive"
8,My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived
8,I had visited it frequently during my boyhood
8,"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix"
8,The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock
8,"“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me"
8,I will keep no terms with my enemies
8,I thought of the occurrences of the day
8,“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings
8,“The words induced me to turn towards myself
8,“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers
8,My person was hideous and my stature gigantic
8,The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair
8,I thank you and accept your generous offer
8,“This was then the reward of my benevolence
8,Shall I respect man when he condemns me
8,"He saw my change of feeling and continued,"
8,His words had a strange effect upon me
8,These feelings dictated my answer to my father
8,"Alas, how great was the contrast between us"
8,Does it now only exist in my memory
8,For my own part I was not sorry
8,Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor
8,"Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful"
8,"Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr"
8,He wished me to seek amusement in society
8,Yet I would die to make her happy
8,What agonising fondness did I feel for them
8,“Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you
8,Did you not call this a glorious expedition
8,It is past; I am returning to England
8,"There he lies, white and cold in death"
7,“What a noble fellow.” you will exclaim
7,"I will be cool, persevering, and prudent."
7,You would not if you saw him
7,I expressed these feelings in my answer.
7,From Italy they visited Germany and France
7,He became the victim of its weakness
7,They were fond of the sweet orphan
7,The most learned philosopher knew little more
7,I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
7,Clerval spent the last evening with us
7,I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge
7,Krempe had given me concerning the lectures
7,This professor was very unlike his colleague
7,I closed not my eyes that night
7,On the same day I paid M
7,What is the cause of all this.”
7,"“D—n the fellow.” cried he; “why, M"
7,"“Your affectionate and afflicted father,
“Alphonse Frankenstein."
7,"He soon reached the summit, and disappeared."
7,he was our darling and our pride.”
7,But since the murderer has been discovered—”
7,"Poor, poor girl, is she the accused"
7,She welcomed me with the greatest affection
7,Justine was called on for her defence
7,"Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed"
7,I am well acquainted with the accused
7,I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness
7,She indeed gained the resignation she desired
7,This change was particularly agreeable to me
7,Our house was the house of mourning
7,What were rain and storm to me
7,"“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon"
7,How dare you sport thus with life
7,"Oh, praise the eternal justice of man"
7,You have made me wretched beyond expression
7,Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy
7,“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly
7,“I spent the winter in this manner
7,“Of what a strange nature is knowledge
7,“But where were my friends and relations
7,He was tried and condemned to death
7,“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings
7,I remembered Adam’s supplication to his Creator
7,‘Who is there.’ said the old man
7,"“I sat down, and a silence ensued"
7,"I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune"
7,“Felix trembled violently as he said this
7,“But how was I to direct myself
7,My papa is a syndic—he is M
7,I am malicious because I am miserable
7,I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely
7,It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene
7,Do you dare to break your promise
7,Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”
7,"“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks"
7,"“Are you better now, sir.” said she."
7,"“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr"
7,Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance
7,I saw a change in her also
7,She wept with me and for me
7,"“My dear Victor, do not speak thus"
7,Such were the lessons of my father
7,How happy and serene all nature appears.”
7,Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
7,"Such a monster has, then, really existence"
7,"“Are you mad, my friend.” said he"
7,Must I then lose this admirable being
7,Heaven bless you and make you so.
7,"They entered, and their leader addressed me"
7,What do you demand of your captain
7,"Be men, or be more than men"
7,what a scene has just taken place
7,“That is also my victim.” he exclaimed
7,"He is cold, he cannot answer me.”"
7,"“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous"
7,“And do you dream.” said the dæmon
7,"Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings"
7,Soon these burning miseries will be extinct
6,But to return to dearer considerations
6,But success shall crown my endeavours
6,This appearance excited our unqualified wonder
6,Several months passed in this manner
6,She appeared of a different stock
6,Nor were these my only visions
6,Waldman I found a true friend
6,Do not laugh in that manner
6,What must have been his feelings
6,How shall I ever repay you
6,"“Is that all, my dear Henry"
6,It was from my own Elizabeth:
6,"Her ugly sister, Manon, married M"
6,"Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn"
6,I have murdered my darling child.’
6,"My dear friend, what has happened.”"
6,What do you intend to do.”
6,how do you welcome your wanderer
6,who could attempt to pursue him
6,"Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”"
6,At that instant my father entered
6,We were soon joined by Elizabeth
6,“How kind and generous you are
6,The appearance of Justine was calm
6,But here also I am checked
6,Did the murderer place it there
6,The God of heaven forgive me
6,"But do not mourn, dear girl"
6,And on the morrow Justine died
6,"Dear Victor, banish these dark passions"
6,It is a scene terrifically desolate
6,"He easily eluded me and said,"
6,"Finding the door open, I entered"
6,It was not thus with Felix
6,This idea was torture to him
6,"She fell, however, into good hands"
6,But let us change the subject
6,“‘Great God.’ exclaimed the old man
6,What a miserable night I passed
6,"‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster"
6,"She moved again, and I fled."
6,"Turning to him, therefore, I said,"
6,And where does he now exist
6,I will proceed with my tale.
6,From thence we proceeded to Oxford
6,It was here that Charles I
6,I was formed for peaceful happiness
6,He entreated me to write often
6,"I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain"
6,Fortunately I had money with me
6,Is not this a free country.”
6,Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness
6,“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest.”
6,The season of the assizes approached
6,The voyage came to an end
6,"We landed, and proceeded to Paris"
6,I abhorred the face of man
6,My letter was calm and affectionate
6,"“Have you, then, some other attachment.”"
6,I took the hand of Elizabeth
6,Why did I not then expire
6,Could I behold this and live
6,"I pressed on, but in vain"
6,No; I am not so selfish
6,"Turning towards the men, he said,"
6,Yes; I cannot withstand their demands
6,Yet why do I say this
6,I called on him to stay.
6,"Nay, then I was not miserable"
6,No sympathy may I ever find
6,Was there no injustice in this
5,Do you understand this feeling
5,"Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret"
5,"This, briefly, is his story"
5,I love you very tenderly
5,"Your affectionate brother,
Robert Walton"
5,Heaven bless my beloved sister.
5,Do you share my madness
5,The apparition was soon explained
5,"Krempe, professor of natural philosophy"
5,I replied in the affirmative
5,"“I am happy,” said M"
5,I passed the night wretchedly
5,“Get well—and return to us
5,"Moritz, treated her very ill"
5,My journey was very melancholy
5,I wept like a child
5,"My country, my beloved country"
5,I could not doubt it
5,He still remained to me
5,Had my eyes deceived me
5,Justine shook her head mournfully
5,Who dared talk of that
5,This also was my doing
5,But that could not be
5,Yet I am certainly unjust
5,You purpose to kill me
5,I will not hear you
5,“How can I move thee
5,They spurn and hate me
5,How miraculous did this appear
5,"She followed, and they disappeared"
5,The meal was quickly dispatched
5,“They were not entirely happy
5,What did their tears imply
5,Did they really express pain
5,You doubtless recollect these papers
5,I sickened as I read
5,“‘Where do these friends reside.’
5,I had certainly acted imprudently
5,All there was at peace
5,You dare not keep me.’
5,This being you must create.”
5,“How inconstant are your feelings
5,"“My dear father, reassure yourself"
5,"You may hate, but beware"
5,Leave me; I am inexorable.”
5,A fever succeeded to this
5,Why did I not die
5,“Is my father indeed come
5,"How kind, how very kind"
5,But this is false reasoning
5,"“You are sorrowful, my love"
5,What is it you fear.”
5,Tears streamed from my eyes
5,What then became of me
5,"“You are mistaken,” said he"
5,But your direction was northwards
5,“And wherefore was it glorious
5,"“Do you, then, really return.”"
5,What do these sounds portend
5,I must arise and examine
5,Evil thenceforth became my good
5,My work is nearly complete
4,"Your affectionate brother,
R"
4,"Archangel, 28th March, 17—."
4,"Adieu, my dear Margaret"
4,But I must finish
4,"“Every minute,” continued M"
4,Waldman entered shortly after
4,How ill you are
4,What could it be
4,"“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”"
4,What could I do
4,"Victor, he is murdered."
4,He was not there
4,"“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”"
4,my own beautiful lake
4,What did he there
4,Beloved and venerable parent
4,how can that be
4,This speech calmed me
4,But she has confessed.”
4,My cousin wept also.
4,"“Oh, Justine.” said she"
4,What could I do
4,Why did you confess
4,You shall not die
4,I could not answer
4,“I truly thank him
4,I was now free
4,Remorse extinguished every hope
4,But she was innocent
4,Fiend that thou art
4,"Listen to me, Frankenstein"
4,And what was I
4,“He did not succeed
4,It impressed me deeply
4,What did this mean
4,Whence did I come
4,What was my destination
4,But where was mine
4,"“‘No, they are French"
4,Save and protect me
4,Why did I live
4,You are an ogre
4,Frankenstein—he will punish you
4,“I intended to reason
4,had collected his forces
4,"Kirwin hastened to say,"
4,My strength was gone
4,"Tell me, dearest Victor"
4,"“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”"
4,Sweet and beloved Elizabeth
4,What a divine day
4,I arrived at Geneva
4,This speech troubled me
4,“What do you mean
4,"Good night, my sister."
4,Generous and self-devoted being
4,Yet when she died
